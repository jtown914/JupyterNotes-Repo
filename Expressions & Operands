## Expressions & Operands (Python Notes)

# set i equal to a number
i=2

#Logical Test:
    # == is used to mean "is equal to", and the output is a TRUE or FALSE answer.
i=2
i==5
    # != is used to mean "is NOT equal to" and the output is a TRUE or FALSE answer.
i=3
i!=4

# Branching
    # IF statement Logic: If statements are like an excclusive nightclub that every condition wants to get into. Only the true ones can gain entrance. 
        # Hence, IF the statement is true, THEN the program will run. 
    ##Syntax: 
    # {
    #   if (condition):
    #        print ("What appears if TRUE")
    #        print ("What appears if FALSE")
    # }

# first we set age = 19, then define our conditions. 
age=19
# note: PAY ATTENTION TO THE INDENTATIONS HERE! A tab/indent is required for the 'print()' commands following the "if:" and "else:" conditions.
if (age>18):
    print("You may Enter, kind sir.")#this will run if the variable meedts the first condition.
else:
    print ("Back of the line, pal!")
    #this (AFTER "else:) " will run if the variable does not meet the condition.
print("It's gonna be a long night, so buckle up.") 
#this (NOT after "else:") will run regardless of whether any other condition is met, and does not require a tab/indent.

# The "elif: statement (short for "else if") allows us to check additional conditions if the preceding condition is false. If the condition is true, the alternate expressions will be run.
age=12
if(age>=19):
    print("You may attend the AC/DC Showing")
elif(age==18):
    print("You can attend Pink Floyd's performance but not AC/DC's performance")
else:
    print("You should be in line for the Goofy-Goobers in Concert.")
print("Okay, move on now. Thank you, next!")
